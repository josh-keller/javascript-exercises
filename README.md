# JavaScript Exercises

These are many of the exercises I went through while learning JavaScript. Most
exercises are from [Launch School](https://launchschool.com).

## Contents

1. Fundamentals - very basic JS syntax and concepts
2. Small Problems - simple coding problems solved in JS
3. Object Oriented - exercises to learn and practice object-oriented patterns in JS
4. Frontend - DOM, Asynchronous JS, and Events


This repo is a consolidation of exercises. Most of the commit history can
be found in [https://github.com/wboard82/Launch-School](https://github.com/wboard82/Launch-School) but these exercises are scattered throughout different courses.
